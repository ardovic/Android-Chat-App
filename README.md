IMPORTANT: This application won't work if you just fork/clone it, compile and run on your device. You'll get 400/401 errors from Firebase server. Make sure you've created YOUR OWN Firebase project with your own unique SHA-1 certificate. Make sure to update the google-service.json file inside the app/ folder, which you'll have to download upon creating your Firebase project. Last but not least, check the strings.xml file inside app/src/main/res/values/ folder, and change the domain address there to YOUR Firebase Database address.
